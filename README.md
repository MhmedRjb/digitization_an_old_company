> I was thrilled to see that my first useful program. It helped the company make better decisions more quickly, which was a great feeling. 
I learned how to manipulate data using __Python__ and visualize it using __Power BI__ . I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a developer.
However, I made a few mistakes when I was writing the code. I didn't know any better at the time, but I was just trying to__get it working__. I didn't 
think about things like __readability__, __maintainability__, or __scalability__. As a result, my code was a bit of a spaghetti. It was hard to understand, 
and it was even harder to change. I'm glad that I made the mistake of writing messy code. It taught me a __valuable lesson__ that I'll never forget.

The last thing I will do in this project is to make it structured, clean, and object-oriented and shareing Visualization with you after Hideing company information .

# digitization_an_old_company
this repository collect data from different  sources (desktop app, WhatsApp messages, pdfs from emails ) 
and handle it to be useful and understandable in one place
## and the winter is totally coming

  - pandas :heavy_check_mark:
  - numby  :heavy_check_mark:
  - seaborn
  - selenium
- SQL 
- Power BI :heavy_check_mark:
## this project has three steps
### 1. collect the data from the ERP application
